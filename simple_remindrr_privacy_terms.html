    <h2>Privacy Policy &mdash; Simple Remindrr</h2>

    <p>
      Simple Remindrr (&quot;the App,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;our,&quot; or &quot;us&quot;) is a simple productivity and reminder
      application available on iOS and Android. This Privacy Policy explains how the App collects, uses, and protects information
      when you use it.
    </p>

    <div class="summary-box">
      <strong>Quick Summary:</strong> Simple Remindrr does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to us or to third parties.
      All reminder data is stored locally on your device only.
    </div>

    <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>
      We <strong>do not collect</strong>, store, transmit, or process any personally identifiable information (PII).
      The App does not require you to create an account or provide your name, email, or any other personal details to function.
    </p>
    <p>All reminder-related content is stored locally on your device, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reminder names</li>
      <li>Descriptions or notes you enter</li>
      <li>Reminder dates and times</li>
      <li>Optional priority or categorization details</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data is stored solely on your device. It is not transmitted to our servers (we do not operate any backend for this App),
      and it is not shared with any third parties.
    </p>

    <h3>2. How Your Information Is Stored</h3>
    <p>
      The App stores your reminder data using the internal storage mechanisms of your device&apos;s operating system (iOS / Android).
      We do <strong>not</strong> use:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cloud servers or online databases</li>
      <li>External or third-party storage services</li>
      <li>Analytics or tracking services</li>
      <li>Advertising SDKs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you uninstall the App or clear its data from your device, all reminders and related information will be permanently deleted
      from that device. We cannot restore this data because we never receive or store it.
    </p>

    <h3>3. How We Use Information</h3>
    <p>
      Because we do not collect any data, we do <strong>not</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use personal data for analytics or performance tracking</li>
      <li>Use your data for advertising or marketing</li>
      <li>Build user profiles</li>
      <li>Sell or rent any information to third parties</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All data is used locally on your device only to provide the core reminder functionality.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Third-Party Sharing</h3>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> share any information with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Advertisers</li>
      <li>Analytics or data collection companies</li>
      <li>Service providers or partners</li>
      <li>Any third-party organizations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The App contains no embedded third-party tracking or advertising frameworks.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Data Security</h3>
    <p>
      Because the App stores all data locally on your device, the security of your reminder information depends on the security of
      your device itself. We recommend:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using a secure device passcode, Face ID, Touch ID, or equivalent</li>
      <li>Keeping your operating system and security features up to date</li>
      <li>Avoiding unauthorized access to your device</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We are not responsible for any unauthorized access, loss, or disclosure of data that results from your device being lost,
      stolen, compromised, or misused.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Children&apos;s Privacy</h3>
    <p>
      Simple Remindrr does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.
      Because the App does not collect data or require accounts, it is suitable for general audiences. If you believe a child has
      provided us with any personal information, please note that we do not have any mechanism to receive such data and therefore
      hold none.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the &quot;Last Updated&quot; date at the top of this page.
      Continued use of the App after any changes are made will constitute your acceptance of the updated Policy.
    </p>
